Course Project of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course

## Description
The repository contains the R script run_analysis.R which takes the data on from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and provides a clean tidy data set containing the average of the mean and standard deviation of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
